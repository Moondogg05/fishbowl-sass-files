Compile these files using Scout that uses Sass and Compass and you will have a file almost identical to the main.css and responsive.css files on the live site. In Scout, use the Production Environment and Compressed Output Style modes. If you want to see the differences which were made after, run both files through css beautifier (http://html.fwpolice.com/css/) and then do a compare line by line.
